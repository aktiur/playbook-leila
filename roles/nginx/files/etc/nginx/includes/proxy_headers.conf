# helper include for reverse proxies
#
# part of the default jlm2017 config for nginx
# installed via ansible: do not modify here
#
# set up basic headers frequently used by reverse proxies
# to inform end servers about the user they are talking to
#
# Be careful: it must be included in every location block
# if additional headers must be used, as proxy_set_header
# directives are not inherited from upper levels whenever
# another directive is used.
#
# As an example, imagine the following configuration
#
#   server {
#     ...
#
#     proxy_set_header Host $host;
#
#     ...
#
#     location /websocket {
#       proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
#
#       ...
#     }
#   }
#
# In this situation, the Host header WON'T be set for
# requests that match /websocket
